  <description>Do you like The Walking Dead? Are you afraid of The Undead? Good. Because this mod will give you the Heebie-jeebies!

This is not your average Zombie mod. In Zombieland, Zombies are everywhere! They crawl out of the ground in masses, hunt you down, bash your doors and eat you alive! At night, their blood lust will steer them towards your base. So better be prepared!

Zombies attack anything that moves, smells and makes sounds. They do not discriminate and attack your animals, your enemies and even traders. There are rumors of maps with well over one thousand zombies. Shoot them and they keep going, kill them and they respawn.

This Mod features custom controlled Zombies with simulated instincts. Most default Rimworld functions have been disabled on them to allow for a smooth game play experience. Therefore, you cannot select or harvest them.

PS: Aim for the head!
