	<ZombielandDifficultyTitle_Help>The difficulty in Zombieland is mainly controlled by a combination of:\n\n- Threat scale\n- Special zombies\n- Zombie speed\n- Max zombie count\n- Dynamic threat level</ZombielandDifficultyTitle_Help>
	<ZombielandDifficulty_Help>This setting controls the difficulty of almost all things in Zombieland: abilities of zombies like senses, toughness, speed, power. In particular, special zombies are affected and the threat forecast will be much worse on higher difficulties.\n\nNote: 500% is really really difficult so be warned.</ZombielandDifficulty_Help>

	<ZombielandContaminationTitle_Help>Contamination is a late-game challenge that introduces a persistent and spreading hazard to your colony. Originating from various sources like deep drilling and traded items, it transfers between objects, colonists, and the environment. The further your colony grows, the more you need to manage Contamination to keep your colonists safe.\n\nTo monitor current Contamination levels, consult the inspector, details dialog, or mouse-over ground info, where you will find a percentage indicating the contamination level of the object, cell, or pawn in question.</ZombielandContaminationTitle_Help>
	<ZombielandContamination_Help>Adjust the Contamination Intensity to set the baseline rate at which Contamination spreads through various means in your colony. This multiplier affects everything from the amount transferred while constructing to the spread through natural resources. Tread carefully; even small changes can lead to widespread effects.</ZombielandContamination_Help>
	
	<WhenDoZombiesSpawn_Help>In Zombieland, you will face a never-ending invasion of zombies. This setting controls the overall pace and rythm of the game. The three modes are quite different so make sure you choose the right one for your play style and understand how they work. There is an upper limit on the number of zombies, see "Zombies on the map" for more details.</WhenDoZombiesSpawn_Help>
	<SpawnWhenType_AllTheTime_Help>Zombies will spawn relentlessly. Kill them and more will come instantly. This is a challenging mode that makes zombies an omnipresent force that influences all aspects of the game.</SpawnWhenType_AllTheTime_Help>
	<SpawnWhenType_WhenDark_Help>Zombies will only spawn at dark places. This means literally dark and includes areas that are dark during daytime. You can control this mode by setting up light to illuminate your safe areas.</SpawnWhenType_WhenDark_Help>
	<SpawnWhenType_InEventsOnly_Help>This classic way of playing Zombieland spawns zombies in groups. The timing and size of the group depends on many aspects of the current colony. Zombieland events are completely independent from any Rimworld events and do not change the frequency of them.</SpawnWhenType_InEventsOnly_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<HowDoZombiesSpawn_Help>Zombies in Zombieland always come out of the ground. They dig out of soft spots so make sure that your current map has at least some soft/semi-soft ground (no ice only map for example).</HowDoZombiesSpawn_Help>
	<SpawnHowType_AllOverTheMap_Help>If you dare you can play with zombies spawning all over the map. Recommended for the experienced player. To control safe areas, you can build floors or walls. Combine this mode with "when dark" for a challenging way to play Zombieland. And beware of your planting zones!</SpawnHowType_AllOverTheMap_Help>
	<SpawnHowType_FromTheEdges_Help>If you prefer the more classical way of a thread from the edges of the map then this mode is for you.</SpawnHowType_FromTheEdges_Help>
	<SmartWandering_Help>This setting controls how the zombies will move at night. "Random" makes them move like at daytime. "Simple" will make them drift towards the most interesting part of the map but they can become stuck and build groups. And "Smart" will eventually bring them to you.</SmartWandering_Help>
	<Biomes_Help>To prevent zombies from spawning on certain map styles you can exclude biomes here.</Biomes_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<WhatDoZombiesAttack_Help>Zombies do not behave like raiders (with the exception of raging zombies). They are mindless wanderers that only get excited when their senses get activated. This setting allows you to define the creature type that will get them going.</WhatDoZombiesAttack_Help>
	<AttackMode_Everything_Help>Make zombies track and attack anything that moves - even animals. Only stationary weapons like turrets and such will never catch their attention.</AttackMode_Everything_Help>
	<AttackMode_OnlyHumans_Help>This is the "normal" way zombies should work. Their lust for brains makes them hunt human pawns regardless of faction.</AttackMode_OnlyHumans_Help>
	<AttackMode_OnlyColonists_Help>If you think that zombies should never attack anyone else but your colonists, then this is the right mode for you. They might hit back when attacked but will never initiate any aggression.</AttackMode_OnlyColonists_Help>
	<EnemiesAttackZombies_Help>Turn this off and your enemies will ignore and avoid zombies. When turned on, raiders will see them as dangerous and will try their best to fight them. Good luck!</EnemiesAttackZombies_Help>
	<AnimalsAttackZombies_Help>With this on, animals will attack zombies when they hunt or get aggressive. To let them ignore any zombie turn this option off.</AnimalsAttackZombies_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<WhatDoZombiesSmash_Help>When zombies get close to buildings or things, they might start bashing on things nearby. They never plan any sophisticated attack but in larger number and over time, they can bring down your defences.</WhatDoZombiesSmash_Help>
	<SmashMode_Nothing_Help>Make zombies attack only creatures. They will ignore walls, buildings, turrets and other things.</SmashMode_Nothing_Help>
	<SmashMode_DoorsOnly_Help>With this setting, zombies have a rough idea how doors work. They will start bashing on them and the amount of damage will increase with the number of zombies that are close to the door. Also, raging zombies will try extra hard and deal more damage.</SmashMode_DoorsOnly_Help>
	<SmashMode_AnyBuilding_Help>To make zombies really hate all your stuff, use this setting. They will attack anything that is in their vicinity - even ancient danger! This increases the difficulty of the game substantially.</SmashMode_AnyBuilding_Help>
	<SmashOnlyWhenAgitated_Help>To restrict zombie interactions with things to only those zombies that are agitated, check this option. This will make normal wandering zombies non-hostile until they find a trail or sense you or your noise (the little brain mote will tell you when they found something).</SmashOnlyWhenAgitated_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<NewGameTitle_Help>Initially, Zombieland gives your some time to prepare your colony. Try not to extend this period too much - many beginners make that mistake and set this to a large number, then build their colony strong and with many colonists and weapons. When the time comes, Zombieland will then start with a huge number of zombies (the zombie count is always in relation to the strength of the colony) and the game is over quickly. Instead, play Zombieland with zombies early on to get a feeling for how to play.</NewGameTitle_Help>
	<DaysBeforeZombiesCome_Help>This is the number of days until zombies appear for the first time. Keep in mind that even after the time is over, it can still take until the next night or event depending on your settings.</DaysBeforeZombiesCome_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<ZombiesOnTheMap_Help>Zombieland has an internal algorithm that determines the number of zombies that should be on the map at any given time. This depends on many things: number of colonists, capable colonists that can fight, weapons and armor, storyteller difficulty and other things. This number can be arbitrary large and to prevent your game from lagging too much, you can define a maximum limit. Keep in mind that Zombieland is designed to put lots of zombies on the map, playing with a handful of zombies is probably not what you want.</ZombiesOnTheMap_Help>
	<MaximumNumberOfZombies_Help>The upper limit of zombies on a given map tile. Actual numbers can be lower depending on the colony.</MaximumNumberOfZombies_Help>
	<ColonyMultiplier_Help>Sometimes, Zombieland estimates too few zombies. For example, if you want to play with very few colonists but want the number of zombies to be high nevertheless. With this multiplier, you can tell Zombieland that your colony is x times more capable of defending itself. This will increase the number of zombies for when you really want that challenge (but the upper limit is always respected).</ColonyMultiplier_Help>

	<DynamicThreatLevelTitle_Help>This section lets you switch between a constant and dynamic amount of zombies.</DynamicThreatLevelTitle_Help>
	<UseDynamicThreatLevel_Help>Here you to can make the number of zombies on the map dynamically. This means that you get a forecast on the right side of the screen to plan your actions ahead.</UseDynamicThreatLevel_Help>
	<DynamicThreatSmoothness_Help>Determines the smoothness of the threat curve.</DynamicThreatSmoothness_Help>
	<DynamicThreatStretch_Help>With this setting you can stretch the curve and make it less dynamic.</DynamicThreatStretch_Help>
	<ZombiesDieOnZeroThreat_Help>All zombies on the map die on their own if the threat level is 0%.</ZombiesDieOnZeroThreat_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<ZombieEventTitle_Help>If you play with "in events only" and sometimes even in the other modes, Zombieland will trigger a zombie attack. This is not like a raider event but instead, a larger number of zombies appear together and depending on the group size, might even rage and start tracking towards you.</ZombieEventTitle_Help>
	<ZombiesPerColonistInEvent_Help>To control the size of the event, you can specify how many zombies per colonist will appear. Please note, that this does not change the overall limit of zombies on the map and if the current number of zombies is already close to the total limit or to the number that Zombieland has determined for your current colony size, less zombies will be in the event. Putting a really large number here will only remove the upper event size limit. Setting a small number will reduce the overall event size - especially with fewer fight-capable colonists.</ZombiesPerColonistInEvent_Help>
	<ExtraDaysBetweenEvents_Help>Normally, zombie events are spaced out automatically. The actual interval depends on a few internal factors. In case you think that this is too frequent, you can use this setting to add extra days between events.</ExtraDaysBetweenEvents_Help>
	<InfectedRaidsChance_Help>This is the chance that a hostile/friendly group arriving on the map is already infected and no interaction between them and the zombies happens.</InfectedRaidsChance_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<ZombieSpeedTitle_Help>Zombie speed is the setting that allows you to balance the difficulty level most. If you feel that Zombieland is too difficult, start reducing the speed a lot. Fast zombies are usually very deadly. There are two speeds to set: one for calmly wandering zombies and one for those who have started tracking you.</ZombieSpeedTitle_Help>
	<MoveSpeedIdle_Help>The normal walk speed of zombies. That excludes raging or agitated zombies.</MoveSpeedIdle_Help>
	<MoveSpeedTracking_Help>Once zombies get excited/agitated they will use this speed setting. This will usually be when they are close to your colonists so setting this high will require you to keep an eye on any sudden zombie contacts you do not want to miss.</MoveSpeedTracking_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<ZombieDamageTitle_Help>Change what happens when zombies attack other creatures.</ZombieDamageTitle_Help>
	<ZombieDamageFactor_Help>A large multiplier will increase their strength which will allow them to overcome others easily. Very useful for mech raids but will deteriorate your walls and doors quicker (if you have that turned on).</ZombieDamageFactor_Help>
	<SafeMeleeLimit_Help>The number of zombies that can be fought simultaneously in a melee fight before the defender is overwhelmed and starts getting bitten.\n\nTank zombies count as two zombies and defenders melee level 0-20 gives you 0-100% chance to block a bite (better with less zombies than the limit)</SafeMeleeLimit_Help>
	<ZombiesCauseManhunting_Help>Will animals become manhunters when attacked by zombies?</ZombiesCauseManhunting_Help>

	<!-- -->

	<ZombieGameTweaks_Help>This section contain miscellaneous tweaks to the game to balance gameplay with zombies a bit more.</ZombieGameTweaks_Help>
	<ReduceTurretConsumption_Help>The constant pressure of zombies will make turrets use a lot of steel. This setting allows you to reduce the amount of steel needed to keep turrets operational. Keep in mind that this is a reduction setting. Higher numbers mean less consumption.</ReduceTurretConsumption_Help>

	<ZombieInfection_Help>Zombie scratches are harmless but bites can give you fatal infections.\n\nZombieland has four stages of infection:\n- unknown (white color)\n- developing (orange)\n- infecting (red, zombie-like)\n- zombie (complete zombie)\n\nYou can either amputate the infected part or do an operation with zombie serum (made out of zombie extract) to remove the infection.</ZombieInfection_Help>
	<ZombieBiteInfectionChance_Help>This is the chance that a zombie bite will infect the limb or body part it is part of. Bites are infectious but scratches are not.</ZombieBiteInfectionChance_Help>
	<ZombieBiteInfectionUnknown_Help>This is the first phase (white). You can treat the wound but you don't know if it will ever get infected until this phase ends.</ZombieBiteInfectionUnknown_Help>
	<ZombieBiteInfectionTreatable_Help>In this second phase (orange), the infection is still treatable. If you can amputate, you can stop the infection. Treatment must happen under optimal conditions (something you need to find out yourself). Also, you only get one chance of treatment, once the wound was treated you cannot re-treat it in a better way.</ZombieBiteInfectionTreatable_Help>
	<ZombieBiteInfectionPersists_Help>The third and last phase (red). Now the infection cannot be treated anymore and only amputation can stop the process. Many players make the mistake and end the life of their infected colonist too early. Zombieland, while cruel, has a few surprises build in to make this phase useful for you. Find out how the colonist has changed/morphed into while almost becoming a zombie!</ZombieBiteInfectionPersists_Help>
	<AnyTreatmentStopsInfection_Help>To allow simple treatment in a bed to stop an infected bite, select this option. It is a good idea to turn this on when you are not yet familiar with the game mechanics.</AnyTreatmentStopsInfection_Help>
	<HoursAfterDeathToBecomeZombie_Help>The time for a dead humanlike pawn to become a zombie. Move all to the left to turns this feature off.</HoursAfterDeathToBecomeZombie_Help>
	<DeadBecomesZombieMessage_Help>Turns the message on/off that indicates that someone turned into a zombie.</DeadBecomesZombieMessage_Help>
	<DangerousSituationMessage_Help>Be notified when something dangerous (like zombies being pushed over your walls) happens.</DangerousSituationMessage_Help>

	<ZombieHarvestingTitle_Help>When zombies die they may drop some of their apparel and you can get zombie extract from their corpses before they disappear. In order to not get overloaded with lots of corpses, you can select how fast zombie corpses disappear.\n\nZombie serum is the best alternative to cure infections. The serum is made out of zombie extract and comes in qualities of 10% to 100% and one potion of serum heals one zombie bite. The quality determines the failure risk when doing an operation on an infected colonist.</ZombieHarvestingTitle_Help>
	<CorpsesExtractAmount_Help>You collect zombie extract from dead zombies before they disappear either automatic or by right-click on the zombie corpse and make serum out of it on a drug table or a crafting spot if you play with tribals. Only colonists assigned to doctoring can collect extract. And only if there are no dangerous zombies nearby (roughly 10-20 cell radius) depending on the surroundings. To make creating serum easier, increase the amount of extract per zombie.</CorpsesExtractAmount_Help>
	<LootExtractAmount_Help>Make zombies drop their apparel by chance. Zombies can wear any apparel that exists in your game with all its mods. This defines the chance and amount of dropped apparel (100% = 1 item)</LootExtractAmount_Help>
	<CorpsesDaysToDessicated_Help>Zombie corpses will usually dessicate quickly so you don't end up with too many of them. To make collecting extract easier, you can increase the time before they disappear.</CorpsesDaysToDessicated_Help>
	<ExtractZombieArea_Help>Extraction from zombies can be dangerous. Use this feature to restrict the activity to one of your areas. If you rename the area, you need to update it here. Manually ordered extraction will always work.</ExtractZombieArea_Help>
	<Apparel_Help>Don't want your zombies to wear some apparel? Blacklist it here by checking its checkbox in the dialog.\n\nGood if some modded apparel causes errors or just for more control.</Apparel_Help>

They will be stronger and faster than normal. Try preventing zombie hordes from becoming to large or stuck at places on the map to avoid raging zombies.</RagingZombies_Help>
	<RageLevel_Help>This level controls the group size that triggers raging zombies. High levels are more dangerous and make zombies trigger more easily.</RageLevel_Help>

	<ZombieHealthTitle_Help>Since zombie are technically dead, they don't have "health". Zombieland can either make it easier or harder to kill zombies.</ZombieHealthTitle_Help>
	<DoubleTapRequired_Help>This option will make zombies recover from injuries. You need to deal damage more constantly or else they will keep going. Injured zombies can become "crawlers" that move slowly and only attack legs. Turn this off for normal Rimworld like damage.</DoubleTapRequired_Help>
	<ZombiesDieVeryEasily_Help>Another great option for beginners and players that want a more arcade style gameplay that can be quite fun. When turned on, zombies are 1-shotable and even the smallest injury kills them.</ZombiesDieVeryEasily_Help>
